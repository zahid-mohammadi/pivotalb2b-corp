Our Story

Founded in 2017 by Zahid Mohammadi (Founder & CEO), Pivotal B2B was created to solve one of the biggest frustrations in B2B marketing: generating leads that don’t convert into meaningful revenue.

What started as a small initiative to improve lead quality has grown into a trusted demand generation partner for enterprises and agencies worldwide. From day one, our vision has been clear—help businesses connect with the right buyers, at the right time, with measurable impact.
