Create an animated visual for a website homepage banner that illustrates a sales funnel focused on precision-targeted leads. The animation should be dynamic and engaging, conveying the concept of efficient lead generation and conversion.

Visual Elements & Animation:

Target Accounts:

Begin with a subtle background representing 'target accounts' – this could be abstract geometric shapes, interconnected nodes, or a stylized cityscape.
Visualize these target accounts with a 'glowing' or 'pulsating' effect to indicate their importance.
Precision Targeting:

Introduce a 'targeting' effect, such as a crosshair, radar sweep, or a network of lines converging on the target accounts.
Use particle effects or light trails to show the 'precision' aspect of the targeting.
Lead Generation & Entry:

Show animated figures or icons representing individual leads emerging from the targeted accounts.
Each lead should be accompanied by a small, brief text label displaying their job title (e.g., 'IT Director', 'Marketing VP', 'CIO', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'HR Director', 'CTO', 'CX/UX Director').
The leads should flow smoothly towards the top of the sales funnel.
Vary the colors and style of the lead icons to represent the different departments.
Sales Funnel:

Visually represent the sales funnel as a clear, prominent element in the center of the banner.
Use a gradient or glowing effect to make the funnel stand out.
Animate the leads as they flow down through the funnel, with each stage of the funnel visually distinct (e.g., different colors, sections, or levels of activity).
As the leads move down the funnel, the icons could change appearance to show the progress of the lead.
Conversion:

At the bottom of the funnel, depict a successful conversion. This could be represented by a 'sparkle' effect, a 'check mark' icon, or a burst of light.
Consider adding a visual element that shows the leads being transformed into customers.
Overall Style:

Maintain a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic.
Use a vibrant color palette that aligns with the website's branding.
Ensure the animation is smooth and fluid, with a looping effect for continuous playback.
The animation should be short, and to the point.
