Prompt for Building Pivotal B2B Pipeline Module

Please extend the Pivotal B2B Dashboard with a new section titled “Pivotal B2B Pipeline”, designed as a pipeline and engagement management system. This should function as a lightweight CRM + email engagement platform with full Microsoft 365 integration and newsletter campaign management.

🔹 Core Requirements
1. Pipeline Management

Visual Kanban or stage-based pipeline view (customizable stages such as: New Lead → Engaged → Proposal Sent → Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost).

Ability to move leads between stages manually or via automation triggers.

Lead Profile Page should display:

Contact & company information

Lead source

Current deal stage

Deal value & probability

Engagement history (emails, activities, downloads, calls, notes)

2. Lead Ingestion & Qualification

Automatic addition of leads from:

Asset Downloads (eBooks, Guides, etc.)

Proposal Form submissions

AI-driven qualification for Contact Us form:

If they want to sell to us → Do not add to pipeline.

If they want our services → Add to pipeline.

Manual creation of new opportunities by sales team.

3. Engagement & Communication
a) Newsletter & Bulk Campaigns

Campaign creation tool inside dashboard with:

Audience segmentation (e.g., by stage, source, engagement level).

Personalization options (merge tags for name, company, stage, asset downloaded, etc.).

A/B testing for subject lines and content.

Scheduling campaigns for future delivery.

Send via existing SMTP setup (optimized for bulk campaigns & notifications).

Reporting on open rate, click rate, bounce, and unsubscribes.

b) One-to-One Emails (M365 Integration)

Full connection to Microsoft 365 Email (via OAuth/Graph API):

Send 1:1 emails directly from pipeline.

Emails are sent through the user’s primary Outlook mailbox (not SMTP relay).

All sent messages logged under lead’s profile.

Inbox Sync & Tracking:

System should monitor connected M365 inbox for replies or inbound emails from leads already in pipeline.

Automatically log those interactions in the lead’s engagement history.

Track opens, clicks, and replies for both outbound and inbound 1:1 communication.

4. Lead Tracking & Analytics

Track:

Lead activity timeline (downloads, emails, replies, form submissions).

Email metrics (opens, clicks, replies, bounces).

Pipeline performance (conversion rate, value by stage, win/loss ratio).

Attribution by lead source (Asset, Proposal Form, Contact Us, Manual Add).

Dashboard reports with visual charts for:

Lead engagement levels

Pipeline value by stage

Campaign performance

Forecasting expected revenue

5. Automation & Workflows

Rules for auto-advancing leads (e.g., if lead clicks link in proposal email → move to “Engaged”).

Notifications (e.g., “Lead replied to your email,” “Lead moved to Negotiation”).

Task/reminder creation for follow-ups.

6. User Interface & Experience

Modern, clean UI that matches existing dashboard design.

Quick filters (by stage, lead source, geography, engagement score).

Global search for contacts.

Activity timeline per lead with easy navigation.

7. Security & Permissions

Role-based access:

Admin (full control)

Marketing (campaign creation, email analytics)

Sales (pipeline management, 1:1 emails, deal updates)

Audit log for changes in pipeline and lead data.

8. Integrations & Extensibility

Microsoft 365 integration (full mailbox sync, not just sending).

API endpoints for import/export of pipeline data.

Optional Zapier/Webhook support for external tools.

✅ In short:
Build a CRM-style pipeline system inside Pivotal B2B Dashboard that:

Tracks leads by stage with a beautiful interface.

Auto-adds leads from Asset Downloads/Proposals, AI-screens Contact Us inquiries.

Enables newsletter campaign creation with personalization (via SMTP).

Integrates fully with M365 for 1:1 emails (send & receive) and auto-logging of inbox activity.

Provides engagement tracking, pipeline analytics, automation, and reporting.
