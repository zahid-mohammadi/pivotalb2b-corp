Please redesign the main navigation menu of the Pivotal B2B Dashboard into a modern hierarchical dropdown system, ensuring clarity, scalability, and a premium professional feel.

🔹 Main Goals

Keep the interface organized and intuitive with grouped dropdowns.

Allow quick access to core operational modules (Leads, Pipeline, Accounts, Billing, etc.).

Keep admin, analytics, and content clearly separated.

Use clean icons, consistent typography, and collapsible sections on sidebar or top-nav layout.

Design should look visually balanced on desktop and mobile.

🔹 Recommended Menu Structure
1. Admin Dashboard

Dropdown or expandable section labeled “Admin”.
Sub-items:

System Overview (summary cards for active users, total leads, invoices, etc.)

User Management (admins, roles, permissions, activity log)

Settings

General Settings

Integrations (M365, SMTP, Payment Gateway, API Keys)

Security & Audit Logs

2. Analytics

Dedicated dropdown for analytics and reporting.
Sub-items:

Performance Analytics – global dashboard metrics (traffic, conversions, MQL→SQL rates).

🔹 UX Guidelines

Use a collapsible sidebar (left aligned) or a top-navbar with hover dropdowns.

Icons: Lucide or Feather icons for a minimal, clean aesthetic.

Active module should be visually highlighted with accent color.

Each dropdown expands smoothly with micro-animations (Framer Motion or CSS transitions).

Support role-based visibility (e.g., Billing visible to Admins only).

Use breadcrumbs in sub-pages for orientation.

Search bar at top: universal search for Leads, Accounts, Invoices, Blog Posts, etc.

🔹 Example Top-Level Layout

🔹 Implementation Notes

Keep menu config JSON-driven to allow dynamic permissions and easy future extensions.

Example JSON:

{
  "Admin": ["System Overview", "User Management", "Settings"],
  "Analytics": ["Performance Analytics", "Campaign Analytics", "Financial Reports"],
  "Marketing Content": ["Blog Posts", "eBooks", "Case Studies"],
  "Lead & Pipeline": ["Leads", "Pipeline", "Accounts", "Contacts", "Proposals"],
  "Billing & Accounting": ["Invoices", "Expenses & Bills", "Payments & Receipts", "Reports"]
}


✅ Summary
Design a structured, dropdown-based navigation that groups modules by category for clear hierarchy:

Admin Dashboard / Analytics / Marketing Content / Lead & Pipeline / Billing & Accounting
Use consistent styling, responsive design, icons, and permissions.
