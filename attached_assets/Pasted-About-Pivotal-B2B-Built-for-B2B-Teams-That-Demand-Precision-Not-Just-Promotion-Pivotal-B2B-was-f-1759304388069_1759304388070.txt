About Pivotal B2B

Built for B2B Teams That Demand Precision — Not Just Promotion

Pivotal B2B was founded in 2017 by Zahid Mohammadi with a clear mission:

To help B2B organizations engage only the buyers who matter — by replacing disconnected outreach with targeted, compliant, revenue-focused programs.

Where most providers focus on volume and vanity metrics, Pivotal B2B was built on a different principle:

✅ Pipeline Confidence Over Lead Count
✅ Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Alignment in Every Campaign
✅ Compliant Engagement Across the Full Buying Committee

We operate as a strategic partner, not just a data vendor or lead supplier. Every engagement is structured to ensure marketing effort translates directly into sales momentum.

What We Believe
	•	Quality outweighs volume — always.
	•	Compliance isn’t an obstacle — it’s a competitive advantage.
	•	Content should educate, not interrupt.
	•	Every lead delivered should be relevant, reachable, and revenue-capable.

Our Commitment

Whether you need to activate Account-Based Marketing (ABM), scale content-led demand generation, or strengthen sales pipeline consistency, Pivotal B2B is designed to operate as an extension of your team — not an external vendor.

Let’s build a pipeline that converts — not just one that fills.
